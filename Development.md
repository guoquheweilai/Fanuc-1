### Future Development

#### Possible bug
Whenever I try to add the ```fanuc/Part5_Part6_controller```, the whole simulation gets messed up. I don't know where the problem lies. I invite Gazebo developers to debug this problem and make the solution open source.

#### Future Tutorials

I intend to make future tutorials on ROS and Gazebo using this model. But I am not sure how and when. If you want to use it for that purpose , please go ahead.

#### Controlling Gripper finger

The gripper fingers can't be controlled yet. Because I haven't added their joints to ```config/fanuc_control.yaml``` yet. That's my future plan God willing.

#### Moveit

The best thing develop on this model is to include ```Moveit!``` on this arm. If you think, you can do it, please go ahead.
